<p class="lg:w-1/2">
    I am a practitioner, strategist and researcher in the fields of digital communities and digital media.
    I have collaborated with the United States government in developing global strategy for digital community engagement with the Fulbright Program in over 160 countries.

    I am a full-stack web developer. I have designed and built my own platform - Clusta - a completely unique way to organise, explore and share digital information without the (doom)scrolling.
    Clusta is inspired particularly by my research into Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari and the Japanese concept of relationalism during my Masters degree in Digital Media Culture at Birkbeck, UoL.
