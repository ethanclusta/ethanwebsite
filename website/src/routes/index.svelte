<p class="lg:w-1/2">
    I am a practitioner, strategist and researcher in the fields of digital communities and digital media.
    I have collaborated with the United States government in developing global strategy with over 160 countries for the Fulbright Program's digital community of alumni and grantees.

<p class="lg:w-1/2">
    I am a full-stack web developer. I have designed and built my own platform - Clusta - a completely unique way to organise, explore and share digital information without the (doom)scrolling.
</p>
<br>
<p class="lg:w-1/2">
    Clusta is inspired particularly by my research into Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, the Japanese concept of relationalism and mychorrizhal root systems, which I explored during my Masters degree in Digital Media Culture at Birkbeck, UoL.
