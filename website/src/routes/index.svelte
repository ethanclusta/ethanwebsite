    I am a researcher, practitioner and strategist in the worlds of digital communities and digital media.
    I have collaborated with the United States government in developing global strategy for digital community engagement with the Fulbright Program.

    I am a self-trained web developer, and I have designed and built my own platform - Clusta - a completely unique way to organise, explore and share digital information without the (doom)scrolling.
    Clusta is inspired particularly by my research into Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari during my Masters degree in Digital Media Culture at Birkbeck, UoL.
